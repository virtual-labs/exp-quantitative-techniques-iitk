### About the Experiment 

Grain size in materials science and metallurgy refers to the size of the individual crystalline grains within a material microstructure. It plays a crucial role in determining the materials' mechanical, physical, and even chemical properties. Grain size and accurate measurements are fundamental aspects of materials science and engineering. The ability to control grain size allows for the customization of material properties to meet specific application requirements, thereby making it a critical factor in the design and manufacture of materials and components. Grain size measures are an essential characteristic of microstructures, and they influence different properties of materials, starting from the mechanical properties (strength, toughness, hardness, ductility, etc.).
